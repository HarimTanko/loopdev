The flat was converted from former office space and has just one bedroom, a lounge and separate kitchen and bathroom. What the 1 bedroom flat lacks in size it more than makes up for with bags of features.  It has its own front door off of the courtyard, period softwood sash windows and alternating floor levels. The BTL flat has had very few changes in tenancies since it was purchased.  The current tenant has been in place since 2010.',

It transpired that this would be a new door opening into the world of HMO room lettings. HMO's or Houses of Multiple Occupancy are professionally organised houses with a room for each tenant.  They need to meet a certain criteria for the Private Housing Department to grant a license.  But once done and with full occupancy, these properties really can be the goose that lays the golden egg, every month! We always do a full refurbishment on the HMO's to mitigate tenant problems, long term maintenance and to get the best use of the space with an improved layout..",

      'Loop Lettings Ltd 2nd HMO purchase came in 2016, once we had learned more about the system and first hand experience of having multiple tenants sharing one house. The first HMO with 4 rooms was a real success and so when we got a call that this town house was just on the market there was no hesitation that it should be the next one. The layout was such that with the garage being converted and the extended large lounge being divided to add another room, this became a very easy conversion into 6 rooms. Within 5 weeks we had the first tenant move in to an unfinished hall and staircase and by December 1st, 9 weeks after getting the keys Loop had 5 paying tenants.',

      'Purchased at auction in January 2016 after a 20 minute viewing the week before. The property was already divided into 3 flats. This was a 1 bedroom flat with a large basement and lease of just 63 years that needed extending.The property was not mortgageable at the time of purchase. We converted the basement coal cellar into a habitable room/bedroom 2 and raised the ground floor joists to increase the basement headroom. The basement received a 10 year guarantee and has natural light from the original lightwell that we improved. The rest of the flat was refurbished to a high standard with a new kitchen, bathroom and other finishes. The flat did not sell in June 2016. So, this became an accidental BTL property. It was rented very easily and refinanced to extract 92% of the overall investment costs.',
