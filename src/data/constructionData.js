      'This was a run-down care home when it was purchased by the developer.  Rather than divide the building floor by floor into a number of apartments, a more difficult approach was taken in terms of the refurbishment to divide the structure vertically. This meant that the main building could be transformed into 7 houses, most of which were over 3 floors.  Additionally there was a 2 bedroom single storey unit at the rear of the site.  Although the project was very challenging at times and introducing stringent sound barriers was difficult, the project was completed on time and on budget. Post completion the project received a St Albans Civic Society commendation award and Loop Construction were named as one of the contributing parties towards this achievement.  Pages 4 & 5.',

      'Construction of 4 townhouses on a sloping site, originally part of another properties garden.  The houses were constructed with a Sika waterproof reinforced basement wall on three sides to create a lower ground floor with the kitchen/dining area leading out onto the garden area.  Above this at ground floor was the living space and 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms to the the upper floors. The house was built with traditional brick and blockwork cavity walls, timber floor joists and factory finished sash windows.  The roof was completed with slate roof tiles. Solar panels were incorporated into the rear roof pitch for heating and hot water purposes. One of the main constraints with this site was the tight access on a cul-de-sac road and scheduling deliveries of bricks and timber around busy neighbour accessible times',

Furthermore, the kitchen was relocated and a kitchen diner layout was created as all modern houses desire.  The client had very good design and furnishings that completed the home to the full extent it deserved. The property is now modern but has retained the character of Hamilton Road.',

The rear and side elevations were extended and the entire roof was replaced with a complimentary clay roof tile. As important to the project success was the brick matching between the old and new sections. We tried very hard to do this and both the client and Loop were very happy with the results. The project was occupied by the client throughout, but normal services were maintained at all times.',

Under normal circumstances this would have been a relatively simple proceedure.  However, the roof construction and finsish were the real project. The thatched roof contractor needed to be booked months in advance and we also had 2 very large lead-lined box gutters to construct.  Both are very skilled trades and not readily available without good management organisation. The property remained occupied throughout.  We completed the internal area with the new kitchen, flooring and joinery.',
