      'This property was purchased in April 2003 as a project to renovate and sell on again.  The kitchen received a small side extension to widen the room. The master bedroom which occupies the entire 2nd floor had a shower room and a large Velux balcony window added. The most endearing feature of the property has to be the 120 ft garden that leads down to a river.  There is no better place to spend a sunny Sunday with a glass of chilled wine watching Dragonflies hover over the river.  This property has to be one of the jewels in the crown. Unable to sell the property in late 2003, it has been a popular and successful BTL property ever since.',
