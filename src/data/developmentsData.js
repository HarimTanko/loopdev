However, we kept in touch with the agent and had first refusal when that buyer pulled out. We are adding 3 bedrooms to the 1st Floor with a large roof conversion.

This was a 1 bedroom flat with a large basement and lease of just 63 years that needed extending. The property was not mortgageable at the time of purchase. We converted the basement coal cellar into a habitable room/bedroom 2 and raised the ground floor joists to increase the basement headroom. The basement received a 10 year guarantee and has natural light from the original lightwell that we improved. The rest of the flat was refurbished to a high standard with a new kitchen, bathroom and other finishes. The flat did not sell in June 2016. However, it was rented very easily and refinanced to extract 92% of the overall investment costs.',

Apart from completing the extension work, we opened up the rear part of the house between the dining area and garage to provide a large kitchen/diner with sliding folding doors looking out onto the 180 ft garden. The staircase was moved to give a completely different ground floor perspective and created a lot of useful space.  The ground floor bathroom was removed and made way for a utility room, separate from the kitchen. The rest of the inside and outside was finished to a high standard without compromising on the budget.  A sale price of £490,000 exceeded the original forecast of £425,000 due to the market and finished product.',
