      'This is a Joint Venture project with a first time investor. We hope to have a very successful project and profit to share. Loop Developments purchased this dated bungalow on the open market when the original buyer pulled out. In December it had already been sold. However, we kept in touch with the agent and had first refusal when that buyer pulled out. We are adding 3 bedrooms to the 1st Floor with a large roof conversion. Plus adding dorma roofs to the front to add some kerb appeal and character.  The ground floor will have a large dining space and decent kitchen to one end. If you are interested in investing with us please get in contact to discuss any opportunities that may be of benefit to both parties.',

      'A dated and run-down 3 bedroom bungalow purchased on the open market in 2015. We had to have Blue asbestos professionally removed from the property by a licensed contractor.  The entire roof was replaced and at the time we formed a vaulted ceiling over the kitchen, bathroom and ensuite. We altered the internal layout to provide a large kitchen diner at the rear where sliding/folding doors opened onto the level limestone patio and garden. Plantation shutters were fitted to most windows as well as the usual high level of finishes expected from Loop. A sale price was secured later than originally planned, but at £530,000 rather than our original forecast of £425,000.',

      'Purchased at auction in January 2016 after a 20 minute viewing the week before. The property was already divided into 3 flats. This was a 1 bedroom flat with a large basement and lease of just 63 years that needed extending. The property was not mortgageable at the time of purchase. We converted the basement coal cellar into a habitable room/bedroom 2 and raised the ground floor joists to increase the basement headroom. The basement received a 10 year guarantee and has natural light from the original lightwell that we improved. The rest of the flat was refurbished to a high standard with a new kitchen, bathroom and other finishes. The flat did not sell in June 2016. However, it was rented very easily and refinanced to extract 92% of the overall investment costs.',

      'Purchased through a property finder, the property had in fact been on the open market for about 6 months, but a sensible offer had not been achieved.  The previous owners had started the double storey extension but it had not been completed and most purchasers could only get lending as a 2 bedroom house, not the 4 bedrooms of the proposed new layout. Apart from completing the extension work, we opened up the rear part of the house between the dining area and garage to provide a large kitchen/diner with sliding folding doors looking out onto the 180 ft garden. The staircase was moved to give a completely different ground floor perspective and created a lot of useful space.  The ground floor bathroom was removed and made way for a utility room, separate from the kitchen. The rest of the inside and outside was finished to a high standard without compromising on the budget.  A sale price of £490,000 exceeded the original forecast of £425,000 due to the market and finished product.',

      'After to agreeing a purchase price in August 2013, the vendor then accepted a higher price from somebody else.  I was approached again in December 2013 to see if my offer still stood.  I agreed and purchased the probate property. Apart from adding French doors to the back of the living room, the rest of the house simply needed a refurbishment to a good standard.  Every room was upgraded and the garden was tidied with a new lawn laid.',

      'Purchased at auction in April 2013. This was a 1 bedroom retirement flat.  Only a minor cosmetic upgrade was necessary before increasing the sale value. This included redecorating and tiling the bathroom.  We also replaced the electric heaters, light fittings and added some window blinds. A purchaser was secured within 2 weeks after getting the keys, from someone that should have attended the auction.  The work was completed in 5 weeks.',
